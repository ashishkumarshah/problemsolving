# Problem Solving

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ashishkumarshah/problemsolving.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ashishkumarshah/problemsolving)

This is a collection of simple problems with their solutions in java. I want this project to be a collection of code with its test cases, so that it can act as a reference manual to someone looking for solutions to simple problems.
